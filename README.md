# ABCD_dnn_grid

Authors: Jeong Hwa Kim, Suyong Choi (Korea University, Department of Physics)

We implement Bayesian neural net (DenseFlipout) to estimate backgrounds from particle physics events. Similar to ABCD method, events are parametrized with two variables. When trained with a subsection of the parameter space, the neural network can map out the remaining region and hence reconstruct the distribution of the events. This is an extension to https://github.com/suyong-choi/ABCDnn.
